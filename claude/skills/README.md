# ATFT Claude Skills

This directory packages Claude Code **skills** tailored to the ATFT-GAT-FAN project.  
Each skill is a Markdown file with a YAML front matter header that Claude Code ingests to gain project-specific operating procedures.

## Skills Included

| Skill | Purpose | Key Commands |
|---|---|---|
| `atft-pipeline` | GPU-accelerated dataset generation, cache hygiene, J-Quants orchestration | `make dataset-bg`, `make dataset-gpu-refresh`, `make cache-stats` |
| `atft-training` | GAT training lifecycle, monitoring, hyper-parameter sweeps | `make train-optimized`, `make train-safe`, `make hpo-run` |
| `atft-research` | Metrics analysis, factor drift diagnostics, report generation | `make research-plus`, `python scripts/research/*.py` |
| `atft-code-quality` | Lint, format, typing, testing, dependency hygiene | `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`, `pre-commit` |
| `atft-autonomy` | Bridge Claude skills with OpenAI Codex autonomous runs | `./tools/claude-code.sh`, `./tools/codex.sh --max`, cron routines |

## Installation (local developer workstation)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
rsync -av claude/skills/ ~/.claude/skills/
for skill in ~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  echo "Installed $(basename "$(dirname "$skill")")"
done
```

Restart Claude Code to pick up the new skills. They run in **proactive** mode, so Claude will automatically leverage them whenever tasks match their scope.  
For Codex-powered workflows, ensure `npm install -g @openai/codex` is completed and `.mcp.json` exists (generated by `tools/codex.sh`).

## Updating Skills

1. Edit the relevant `SKILL.md` in this directory.
2. Run `rsync` again to sync changes to `~/.claude/skills/`.
3. Document updates in `docs/SKILLS_GUIDE.md` (change log section).
