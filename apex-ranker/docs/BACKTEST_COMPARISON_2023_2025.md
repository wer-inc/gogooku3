# APEX-Ranker Backtest Comparison (2023-2025)

**⚠️ DEPRECATED - Historical Reference Only**

This document contains backtest results from **Phase 3.4** (2025-10-29) using **old code** (commit 5dcd8ba, pre-Task 4.1.1). These results have been superseded by Phase 3.5 verification findings.

**Issue Identified**: The original backtest actually used **daily rebalancing** (not weekly as labeled), causing excessive transaction costs.

**For current baseline results**, see:
- **Reproducibility Verification Report**: `apex-ranker/docs/REPRODUCIBILITY_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`
- **Updated Status**: `apex-ranker/EXPERIMENT_STATUS.md` (Phase 3.5)

| **Sharpe Ratio** | 0.624 | **0.933** | +49.5% |
| **Sortino Ratio** | 0.747 | **1.116** | +49.4% |
| **Max Drawdown** | 29.14% | **20.01%** | -31.3% |

- **Excluded Features**: 25 underperforming features
  - Bottom 10 negative-impact features
  - 15 zero-impact market features

### Enhanced Model
- **Features**: 89 (full feature set)
- **Checkpoint**: `models/apex_ranker_v0_enhanced.pt`
- **Config**: `apex-ranker/configs/v0_base.yaml`
- **Feature Groups**: All enabled
  - Technical indicators
  - Flow features
  - Quality metrics
  - Market features

## Transaction Costs Analysis

| Metric | Pruned Model | Enhanced Model | Observation |
|--------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Total Trades** | 47,866 | 52,387 | +9.4% |
| **Total Costs** | ¥10,239,983 | ¥15,594,539 | +52.3% |
| **Cost % of Capital** | 102.40% | 155.95% | +52.4% |
| **Avg Daily Cost (bps)** | 14.88 | 22.67 | +52.4% |

**Key Insight**: Transaction costs are extremely high (>100% of capital) due to:
1. Weekly rebalancing with 50-stock portfolio
2. High turnover (40-50% avg daily)
3. Conservative cost assumptions (commission + slippage)

**Recommendation**:
- Reduce rebalancing frequency (e.g., monthly instead of weekly)
- Increase position size threshold for trades
- Consider transaction cost-aware portfolio optimization

## Risk-Adjusted Performance

### Sharpe Ratio Analysis
The enhanced model's Sharpe ratio of **0.933** indicates strong risk-adjusted returns:
- Industry benchmark (long-only equity): ~0.5-0.7
- APEX-Ranker enhanced: **0.933** (+33% vs industry)

### Drawdown Analysis
The enhanced model demonstrates **superior downside protection**:
- **20.01% max drawdown** vs 29.14% for pruned
- **31.3% better drawdown control**
- Calmar ratio (return/drawdown) **2x better** (0.890 vs 0.445)

## Period-by-Period Analysis

### 2023 Performance
Both models navigated 2023 volatility similarly:
- Started with initial drawdown (Jan-Mar)
- Recovery and growth (Apr-Aug)
- Year-end correction (Dec)

### 2024 Performance
Enhanced model pulled ahead:
- Better recovery from Feb-Mar selloff
- Strong performance in summer rally (Jul-Aug)
- Resilient during Q3-Q4 volatility

### 2025 Performance (YTD)
Enhanced model's outperformance accelerated:

- **Net return = Gross return - Transaction costs**
- Cost optimization is essential for production deployment

### 3. Risk Management
- Enhanced model: Better drawdown control
- Sharpe ratio improved 49.5%
- Sortino ratio improved 49.4%

### 4. Consistency
- Win rate identical (52.4%)

## Production Recommendations

### For Immediate Deployment (Q4 2025):

1. **Model Selection**: Use **enhanced model** (`apex_ranker_v0_enhanced.pt`)
   - 56.43% total return vs 39.48%
   - Superior risk-adjusted metrics
   - Better downside protection

2. **Portfolio Configuration**:
   - **Top-K**: Reduce from 50 to 30-40 stocks
   - **Rebalancing**: Monthly instead of weekly (reduce costs by ~75%)
   - **Position sizing**: Min threshold to avoid small trades

3. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Target <30% transaction costs (vs current 156%)
   - Implement cost-aware rebalancing
   - Use execution algorithms to minimize slippage

4. **Risk Management**:
   - Stop-loss: 15-20% drawdown limit
   - Position limits: Max 5% per stock
   - Sector diversification constraints

### For Phase 4 Development:

1. **Walk-Forward Validation**:
   - Implement rolling 252-day training window
   - Out-of-sample testing on 2024-2025 data
   - Evaluate model decay and retraining schedule

2. **Cost-Aware Portfolio Optimization**:
   - Integrate transaction costs into optimization objective
   - Turnover penalties in portfolio construction
   - Minimum holding period constraints

3. **Ensemble Methods**:
   - Combine pruned + enhanced predictions
   - Model averaging or stacking
   - Adaptive weighting based on recent performance
