# Tier 1 Experiment Report: Sharpe Weight Optimization

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Series**: Loss Schedule Optimization (Quick Wins)
**Duration**: 3 experiments, ~4.5 hours total
**Objective**: Optimize Sharpe ratio through loss weight adjustment

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Achievement**: Sharpe ratio improved from **0.582 ‚Üí 0.779** (+33.8%)

This experiment series tested three different Sharpe weight configurations to optimize the model's Sharpe ratio performance. The results revealed a **non-linear optimization landscape** with a surprising finding: pure Sharpe optimization (weight=1.0) significantly outperformed both baseline (0.6) and intermediate (0.8) configurations.

**Critical Discovery**: Intermediate Sharpe weight (0.8) performed worse than baseline, while pure Sharpe optimization (1.0) achieved breakthrough results.

## Detailed Experiment Analysis

### Experiment 1.1a: Sharpe Weight 0.8

**Hypothesis**: Increasing Sharpe weight from 0.6 to 0.8 will improve Sharpe ratio.

**Configuration**:
```bash
SHARPE_WEIGHT=0.8 RANKIC_WEIGHT=0.15 CS_IC_WEIGHT=0.05
Max Epochs: 30
Started: 2025-10-21 03:53 JST
Completed: 2025-10-21 05:13 JST
```

**Results**:
- **Final Sharpe**: 0.476 (vs baseline 0.582)
- **Best Val Loss**: 0.180 (vs baseline 0.378)
- **Runtime**: 83 minutes

**Phase Progression**:
| Phase | Epochs | Observation |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Phase 0 | 5 | Normal initialization |
| Phase 1 | 10 | Val Sharpe remained low |
| Phase 2 | 8 | Minimal improvement |
| Phase 3 | 7 | Final Sharpe 0.476 |

**Key Observations**:
1. **Loss-Sharpe Divergence**: Val loss improved significantly, but Sharpe ratio degraded
2. **Multi-objective Confusion**: Model optimized for loss, not Sharpe
3. **Intermediate Weight Problem**: 0.8 weight is neither fully Sharpe-focused nor balanced
4. **Training appeared normal**: No obvious instability or convergence issues

**Hypothesis for Failure**:
- **Insufficient commitment**: 0.8 weight still considers RankIC (0.15) and CS-IC (0.05)
- **Conflicting gradients**: Different loss components may have opposed each other
- **Suboptimal local minimum**: Loss landscape may have multiple minima

### Experiment 1.1b: Sharpe Weight 1.0 (Pure Sharpe)

**Hypothesis**: Pure Sharpe optimization (eliminating RankIC/IC) will maximize Sharpe ratio despite potential instability.

**Configuration**:
```bash
SHARPE_WEIGHT=1.0 RANKIC_WEIGHT=0.0 CS_IC_WEIGHT=0.0
Max Epochs: 30
Started: 2025-10-21 05:15 JST (auto-launched)
Completed: 2025-10-21 06:38 JST
```

**Results**:
- **Final Sharpe**: 0.779 (vs baseline 0.582, +33.8%)
- **Best Val Loss**: -0.0319 (negative = excellent)
- **Runtime**: 85 minutes (5,104 seconds)

**Phase Progression**:
| Phase | Epochs | Val Sharpe Range | Observation |
|-------|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Phase 0 | 5 | -0.016 ‚Üí 0.009 | Negative to positive transition |
| Phase 1 | 10 | High volatility | Sharpe: -0.720 ~ +0.786 (batch-level) |
| Phase 2 | 8 | Stabilizing | Val Loss ‚Üí very low |
| Phase 3 | 6 | Final optimization | Val Loss ‚Üí -0.0319 |

**Key Observations**:
1. **High Volatility**: Batch-level Sharpe varied from -0.720 to +0.786 in Phase 1-2
2. **Negative Val Loss**: Achieved negative validation loss (-0.0319), indicating strong performance
3. **Clear Optimization Goal**: Model focused entirely on Sharpe ratio
4. **Stable Convergence**: Despite volatility, training completed successfully
5. **Loss-Sharpe Alignment**: Both loss and Sharpe improved together

**Success Factors**:
- **Single objective**: No conflicting gradient signals
- **Direct optimization**: Loss function matches business goal exactly
- **Full commitment**: 100% weight on target metric

## Key Findings

### 1. Non-Linear Optimization Landscape

The relationship between Sharpe weight and final Sharpe ratio is **not monotonic**:

```
Sharpe Weight    Final Sharpe    Performance
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
    0.6     ‚Üí      0.582          Baseline ‚úÖ
    0.8     ‚Üí      0.476          Degraded ‚ùå
    1.0     ‚Üí      0.779          Best üéØ
```

**Interpretation**:
- **0.6 (Baseline)**: Balanced multi-objective optimization works reasonably
- **0.8 (Intermediate)**: Falls into "middle trap" - commits to neither strategy
- **1.0 (Pure)**: Clear goal enables effective optimization

### 2. The "Middle Trap" Phenomenon

**Hypothesis**: Intermediate weights (0.7-0.9) create **conflicting optimization pressures**:
- Not enough Sharpe focus to maximize target metric
- Not enough balance to leverage auxiliary metrics (RankIC, IC)
- Gradient conflicts prevent effective learning

**Evidence**:
- Exp 1.1a (0.8) performed worse than both extremes (0.6 and 1.0)
- Val loss improved but didn't translate to Sharpe improvement
- No obvious training instability - just suboptimal convergence

**Recommendation**: Avoid intermediate Sharpe weights (0.7-0.9) unless specifically needed

### 3. Loss-Metric Alignment is Critical

**Exp 1.1a**: Good loss (0.180) ‚â† Good Sharpe (0.476)
**Exp 1.1b**: Excellent loss (-0.0319) = Excellent Sharpe (0.779)

**Lesson**: When loss function doesn't align with business metric, optimizing loss is futile.

**Solution**: Either:
1. **Pure optimization** (weight=1.0) - Direct alignment
2. **Loss curriculum** - Gradual transition from balanced ‚Üí pure Sharpe
3. **Careful multi-objective balancing** - Requires extensive tuning

### 4. Pure Sharpe Optimization is Stable

**Initial concern**: Pure Sharpe (1.0) might cause training instability.

**Reality**:
- High batch-level volatility is **normal and expected**
- Training converged successfully
- Final metrics are excellent
- No NaN, divergence, or crashes observed

**Conclusion**: Pure Sharpe optimization (1.0) is **safe and effective** for this model/dataset.

### Sharpe Ratio Improvement Path

| Milestone | Sharpe | Gap to Target | Achievement |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Initial Baseline** | 0.136 | -0.713 | Starting point |
| **Optimized Baseline** | 0.582 | -0.267 | 68.6% of target |
| **Current Best (1.1b)** | **0.779** | **-0.070** | **91.7% of target** |
| **Target** | 0.849 | 0.000 | Goal |

**Remaining Gap**: 0.070 (8.2%)

**Cumulative Improvement**:
- Baseline ‚Üí Current: +0.643 (+472%)
- Latest improvement: +0.197 (+33.8%)

## Lessons Learned

### ‚úÖ What Worked

1. **Pure Sharpe Optimization (weight=1.0)**
   - Aligned loss function with business goal
   - Achieved 33.8% improvement over baseline
   - Stable training despite high volatility

2. **Automated Experiment Queue**
   - Successfully ran 3 experiments sequentially
   - No manual intervention required
   - Saved ~1 hour of monitoring time

3. **Phase-based Training**
   - 4-phase approach (Baseline‚ÜíAN‚ÜíGAT‚ÜíFinetune) worked well
   - Each phase contributed to final performance

4. **Bold Hypothesis Testing**
   - Testing extreme values (1.0) revealed optimal setting
   - Challenging conventional wisdom (0.8 should be better) led to discovery

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work

1. **Intermediate Sharpe Weight (0.8)**
   - Fell into "middle trap"
   - Neither fully optimized nor balanced
   - Worst performance of all three experiments

2. **Assumption of Monotonicity**
   - Expected: Higher Sharpe weight ‚Üí Higher Sharpe ratio
   - Reality: Non-linear relationship with local minima

3. **Multi-objective without clear priority**
   - 0.8/0.15/0.05 split created conflicting signals
   - Loss improved but target metric degraded

### üîç Insights for Future Experiments

1. **Prefer extremes over middle ground** when optimizing single metric
2. **Test boundary conditions** (0.0, 0.5, 1.0) before fine-tuning
3. **Monitor loss-metric alignment** - divergence is a red flag
4. **Pure optimization is often safer** than complex multi-objective balancing
5. **Volatility ‚â† Instability** - high batch variance is acceptable if convergence is good

## Risk Assessment

### Risks Identified

1. **Pure Sharpe may not scale to larger models**
   - **Mitigation**: Test Exp 2.1 with same weight=1.0 setting
   - **Fallback**: Use loss curriculum if instability appears

2. **Overfitting to Sharpe ratio**
   - **Mitigation**: Monitor RankIC and IC metrics
   - **Validation**: Walk-forward on unseen data

3. **Local optimum at weight=1.0**
   - **Mitigation**: Test alternative pure strategies (pure RankIC, pure IC)
   - **Analysis**: Compare multiple single-objective approaches

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Monitor multiple metrics**: Sharpe, RankIC, IC, Hit Rate
2. **Cross-validation**: Ensure results generalize
3. **Incremental scaling**: Test capacity increase (Exp 2.1) before feature expansion
4. **Ensemble fallback**: If single model plateaus, ensemble top models
