- `idio_vol_ratio`: Idiosyncratic volatility ratio

#### Market Alignment (2 features)
- `trend_align_mkt`: Trend alignment with market
- `alpha_vs_regime`: Alpha vs market regime interaction

## Technical Specifications

### Data Flow
1. TOPIX data fetched via JQuants API (`/indices/topix`)
2. Market features calculated from TOPIX OHLC data
3. Cross features calculated using both stock and market returns
4. Features joined to stock dataset on Date column

### Performance
- **Processing Time**: ~1-2 seconds for market features generation
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal overhead (<100MB for features)
- **Feature Count**: 34 new features added per stock-date observation

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Z-Score Window**: 252 trading days (1 year) for normalization
2. **Beta Window**: 60 days for beta calculation (balance between stability and responsiveness)
3. **Datetime Handling**: Automatic datetime type conversion to handle ms/μs mismatches
4. **Null Handling**: Graceful handling of missing TOPIX data with fallback to simple features

## Testing & Validation

### Test Scripts Created
- `test_market_features.py`: Unit tests for feature generation
- `test_market_integration.py`: Integration test with real data

### Test Results
- ✅ All 26 market features generated successfully
- ✅ All 8 cross features calculated correctly
- ✅ Beta distribution shows reasonable values (majority < 1.5)
- ✅ Integration with existing ML pipeline successful

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.features.market_features import MarketFeaturesGenerator, CrossMarketFeaturesGenerator

# Generate market features from TOPIX
market_gen = MarketFeaturesGenerator()
market_features = market_gen.build_topix_features(topix_df)

# Generate cross features
cross_gen = CrossMarketFeaturesGenerator()
enhanced_df = cross_gen.attach_market_and_cross(stock_df, market_features)
```

### Pipeline Integration
```python
from scripts.data.ml_dataset_builder import MLDatasetBuilder

builder = MLDatasetBuilder()
result = builder.build_enhanced_dataset_with_market()
# Automatically fetches TOPIX and adds all features
```

## Benefits for Short-Term Prediction

1. **Market Regime Detection**: Identify bull/bear markets, high volatility periods
2. **Beta-Adjusted Returns**: Separate market-driven vs stock-specific movements
3. **Relative Strength**: Identify stocks outperforming/underperforming market
4. **Risk Management**: Detect market stress periods, drawdowns
5. **Cross-Sectional Analysis**: Compare stocks within same market context

## Next Steps

1. **Backtesting**: Evaluate feature importance in prediction models
2. **Feature Selection**: Identify most predictive features for 1-3 day horizons
3. **Dynamic Windows**: Experiment with adaptive window sizes
4. **Sector Features**: Add sector-specific market features
5. **Intraday Features**: Incorporate intraday volatility patterns

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required. Uses existing JQuants credentials.

### Parameters
- `z_score_window`: Configurable (default: 252 days)
- `beta_window`: Fixed at 60 days
- `bollinger_period`: Fixed at 20 days
- `atr_period`: Fixed at 14 days

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Beta Calculation**: Some extreme values during low volatility periods
2. **Data Dependency**: Requires at least 252 days of history for full features
3. **Datetime Types**: Manual conversion required for polars datetime compatibility

## Performance Metrics

- **Feature Generation Speed**: 1.9s for 600K+ observations
- **Memory Efficiency**: <8GB for full dataset with features
- **Feature Quality**: Low null rate (<10% for most features after warm-up)

## Conclusion

Successfully implemented a comprehensive set of 34 market-related features that capture:
- Market trends and momentum
- Volatility regimes
- Individual stock vs market relationships
- Risk indicators

These features provide crucial market context for improving short-term (1-3 day) stock price predictions by:
1. Removing market-wide movements to focus on stock-specific signals
2. Identifying favorable/unfavorable market conditions
3. Quantifying systematic vs idiosyncratic risk
4. Enabling regime-aware prediction models
