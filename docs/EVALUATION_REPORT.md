## Phase-by-Phase Analysis

### Phase 0: Baseline

- Epochs: 5
- Val IC mean: 0.0005 (std: 0.0099)
- Val RankIC mean: -0.0066 (std: 0.0180)
- Val Sharpe mean: -0.0400 (std: 0.0142)
- Val Loss mean: 0.3539, min: 0.3505

### Phase 1: Adaptive Norm

- Epochs: 10
- Val IC mean: 0.0052 (std: 0.0164)
- Val RankIC mean: 0.0026 (std: 0.0242)
- Val Sharpe mean: -0.0663 (std: 0.0216)
- Val Loss mean: 0.3551, min: 0.3489

### Phase 2: GAT

- Epochs: 8
- Val IC mean: -0.0121 (std: 0.0246)
- Val RankIC mean: -0.0002 (std: 0.0293)
- Val Sharpe mean: -0.0633 (std: 0.0198)
- Val Loss mean: 0.3610, min: 0.3493

### Phase 3: Fine-tuning

- Epochs: 6
- Val IC mean: 0.0036 (std: 0.0342)
- Val RankIC mean: 0.0106 (std: 0.0331)
- Val Sharpe mean: -0.0745 (std: 0.0056)
- Val Loss mean: 0.3592, min: 0.3457

## Detected Issues

- Sharpe remains negative across phases.
- IC volatility is elevated (> 0.02).
- Prior IC=0 issue appears resolved (near-zero ratio ~0%).


## Peak IC Comparison
- Phase 1 peak IC: 0.0297 -> Phase 3 peak IC: 0.0523
- Peak IC improvement (P1 -> P3): 75.80%

## Recommendations

- Prioritize Sharpe-oriented improvements (costs, loss shaping, sizing).
- Consider Rank/IC-augmented objectives to align with targets.
- Stabilize fine-tuning with lower LR and partial freezing.
- Ensure feature config and model dims are aligned to avoid rebuilds.
