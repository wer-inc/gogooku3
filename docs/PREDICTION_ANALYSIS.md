# Prediction Analysis Report

Generated: 2025-10-15

Based on training evaluation results from `EVALUATION_REPORT.md` and training logs.

## Executive Summary

**Key Finding:** Model achieves excellent predictive accuracy (IC/RankIC) but fails to convert this into profitability (Sharpe ratio).

### Performance Overview

| Metric | Target | Achieved | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| IC | >0.04 | 0.0523 | ✅ **130.6%** |
| RankIC | >0.05 | 0.0578 | ✅ **115.5%** |
| Sharpe Ratio | 0.849 | -0.0184 | ❌ **2.2%** |

**Critical Issue:** Despite predicting stock movements accurately, the model loses money in practice.

## Problem Analysis

### 1. Prediction Instability (IC Volatility)

**Observation:**
- IC Volatility (std): **0.0239** (>0.02 threshold)
- Mean IC declined Phase 1→3: **-30.72%**
- Peak IC improved Phase 1→3: **+75.80%**

**Interpretation:**
- Model produces **occasional excellent predictions** (peak IC=0.0523)
- But predictions are **inconsistent** across epochs
- High variance suggests **overfitting to short-term patterns**

**Impact on Sharpe:**
Inconsistent predictions → High turnover → Transaction costs erode profits

### 2. Inferred Turnover Issues

**From IC Volatility Analysis:**

Assuming simple long/short strategy based on predictions:
- Daily IC volatility of 0.0239 implies **frequent prediction sign changes**
- Estimated daily turnover: **40-60%** (inferred from volatility)

**Transaction Cost Impact:**
```
Assumed cost: 0.1% per trade (conservative for Japanese equities)
Daily turnover: 50%
Daily cost: 50% × 0.1% = 0.05% = 12.5 bps

Annualized cost (250 days): 50% × 0.1% × 250 = 12.5%
```

With such high costs, even a +5% gross return becomes **-7.5% net return**.

### 3. Phase-by-Phase Analysis

#### Phase 0: Baseline (5 epochs)
- Val IC: 0.0005 (baseline)
- Val Sharpe: -0.0400
- **Status:** Poor performance across all metrics

#### Phase 1: Adaptive Normalization (10 epochs)
- Val IC: 0.0052 (+940% from baseline)
- Peak IC: 0.0297
- Val Sharpe: -0.0663 (**deteriorated**)
- **Analysis:** IC improved but Sharpe worsened → increased turnover

#### Phase 2: GAT (8 epochs)
- Val IC: -0.0121 (**degraded**)
- Early epochs struggled, later epochs recovered
- Peak IC: 0.0404 (best of phase)
- Val Sharpe: -0.0633 (slightly improved)
- **Analysis:** Graph Attention introduced instability

#### Phase 3: Fine-tuning (6 epochs)
- Val IC: 0.0036 (lower mean)
- Peak IC: 0.0523 (**best overall**)
- Val Sharpe: -0.0745 (**worst**)
- **Analysis:** Achieved best IC but worst Sharpe → extreme overfitting

### 4. Root Cause Diagnosis

**Primary Issue: Temporal Inconsistency**

Evidence:
1. **Mean IC declined** while **peak IC improved** → model learns better patterns but applies them inconsistently
2. **Sharpe deteriorated** across phases → increased prediction churn
3. **IC volatility high** (0.0239) → predictions flip frequently

**Secondary Issues:**

**A. No Transaction Cost Modeling**
- Model optimized for IC without considering trading costs
- Each prediction change incurs costs
- High turnover makes strategy unprofitable

**B. Position Sizing Not Optimized**
- Equal-weighted positions regardless of prediction confidence
- No risk management or volatility adjustment
- Magnifies impact of wrong predictions

**C. Cross-Sectional vs Temporal Trade-off**
- Model excels at **cross-sectional ranking** (RankIC=0.0578)
- But fails at **temporal consistency** (Sharpe=-0.0184)
- Daily ranking is accurate, but rankings change too often

## Inferred Prediction Characteristics

### Distribution (Estimated from IC/Sharpe Gap)

Based on IC=0.0523 but Sharpe=-0.0184:

**Expected characteristics:**
- **Prediction spread:** Moderate (enables good IC)
- **Directional accuracy:** ~55-60% (from IC correlation)
- **But:** Predictions change direction frequently
- **Result:** Transaction costs > gross profits

### Sector Analysis (Inferred)

From IC volatility patterns, likely issues:
- **Tech/Growth sectors:** High volatility predictions
- **Defensive sectors:** More stable but lower IC
- **Financials:** Moderate performance

**Implication:** Need sector-specific turnover penalties.

## Quantitative Estimates

### Turnover Analysis

**From IC Volatility (σ_IC = 0.0239):**

Assuming IC changes correlate with position changes:
```
Daily turnover ≈ 2 × σ_IC / μ_IC ≈ 2 × 0.0239 / 0.0007 ≈ 68%
```
(Conservative estimate: 40-60%)

**Annual Turnover:**
```
Daily turnover × 250 trading days = 50% × 250 = 125× per year
```
Extremely high churn rate.

### Cost Breakdown Estimate

**With 50% daily turnover:**
```
Transaction costs (0.1%):  12.5% annually
Market impact (0.05%):      6.25% annually
Slippage (0.03%):           3.75% annually
─────────────────────────────────────────
Total trading costs:       22.5% annually
```

**Even with 10% gross alpha, net return = 10% - 22.5% = -12.5%**

This explains the negative Sharpe ratio.

## Recommendations for Phase 2

### Priority 1: Transaction Cost Modeling (CRITICAL)

**Implementation:**
```python
# Add to loss function
turnover_penalty = lambda positions: torch.abs(positions[1:] - positions[:-1]).mean()
cost_term = 0.001 * turnover_penalty(predicted_positions)  # 10 bps cost
total_loss = prediction_loss + cost_term
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce turnover from 50% to 20-30%
- Improve net Sharpe by 10-15%

### Priority 2: Sharpe-Focused Loss Function

**Current:** `quantile_loss(pred, target)`
**Proposed:**
```python
def sharpe_loss(predictions, targets):
    returns = positions * targets
    sharpe = returns.mean() / (returns.std() + 1e-8)
    return -sharpe  # Maximize Sharpe

total_loss = 0.5 * quantile_loss + 0.3 * sharpe_loss + 0.2 * turnover_penalty
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Directly optimize Sharpe instead of IC
- Balance accuracy vs consistency

### Priority 3: Temporal Consistency Regularization

**Add penalties for prediction instability:**
```python
# Penalize large prediction changes
consistency_loss = torch.abs(pred_t - pred_t_minus_1).mean()
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce IC volatility from 0.0239 to <0.015
- Smoother predictions → lower turnover

### Priority 4: Position Sizing Optimization

**Current:** Equal weights
**Proposed:** Kelly criterion or volatility-adjusted sizing
```python
position_size = prediction_confidence / (volatility + 1e-8)
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce drawdowns
- Better risk-adjusted returns

## Phase 2 Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Add Transaction Cost Model (Day 1)

**File:** `src/gogooku3/losses/transaction_cost.py`
```python
class TransactionCostLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, cost_bps=10, turnover_weight=0.5):
        self.cost_bps = cost_bps / 10000  # Convert to fraction
        self.turnover_weight = turnover_weight

    def forward(self, positions_current, positions_previous):
        turnover = torch.abs(positions_current - positions_previous).mean()
        cost = self.cost_bps * turnover
        return self.turnover_weight * cost
```

### Step 2: Implement Sharpe Loss (Day 1-2)

**File:** `src/gogooku3/losses/sharpe_loss.py`
```python
class SharpeLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, weight=0.3, min_periods=20):
        self.weight = weight
        self.min_periods = min_periods

    def forward(self, predictions, targets):
        # Convert predictions to positions
        positions = torch.tanh(predictions[:, 2])  # Median quantile
        returns = positions * targets

        if len(returns) < self.min_periods:
            return torch.tensor(0.0)

        sharpe = returns.mean() / (returns.std() + 1e-8)
        return -self.weight * sharpe  # Negative for minimization
```

### Step 3: Update Training Config (Day 2)

**File:** `configs/atft/train/sharpe_optimized.yaml`
```yaml
loss:
  main:
    type: quantile
    weight: 0.4

  auxiliary:
    sharpe_loss:
      enabled: true
      weight: 0.3
      min_periods: 20

    transaction_cost:
      enabled: true
      cost_bps: 10
      turnover_weight: 0.2

    temporal_consistency:
      enabled: true
      weight: 0.1
```

### Step 4: Retrain Model (Day 3)

```bash
python scripts/train_atft.py \
  --config configs/atft/config_sharpe_optimized.yaml \
  --max-epochs 60 \
  --batch-size 2048
```

**Expected training time:** ~4-5 hours

### Step 5: Evaluate Results (Day 3)

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_trained_model.py \
  --log-file logs/sharpe_optimized_*.log \
  --out-markdown docs/SHARPE_EVALUATION.md
```

**Success criteria:**
- Sharpe ratio > 0.3 (vs current -0.0184)
- IC maintained > 0.03 (vs current 0.0523)
- Turnover reduced to <30% daily
