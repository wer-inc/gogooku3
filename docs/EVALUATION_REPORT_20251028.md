- Val Sharpe mean: 0.0078 (std: 0.0430)
- Val Loss mean: 0.3517, min: 0.3383

### Phase 4: Augmentation

- Epochs: 13
- Val IC mean: 0.0119 (std: 0.0321)
- Val RankIC mean: 0.0112 (std: 0.0305)
- Val Sharpe mean: -0.0133 (std: 0.0283)
- Val Loss mean: 0.3492, min: 0.3357

## Detected Issues

- Sharpe remains negative across phases.
- IC volatility is elevated (> 0.02).
- Prior IC=0 issue appears resolved (near-zero ratio ~0%).


## Peak IC Comparison
- Phase 1 peak IC: 0.0282 -> Phase 3 peak IC: 0.0831
- Peak IC improvement (P1 -> P3): 194.27%

## Recommendations

- Prioritize Sharpe-oriented improvements (costs, loss shaping, sizing).
- Consider Rank/IC-augmented objectives to align with targets.
- Stabilize fine-tuning with lower LR and partial freezing.
- Ensure feature config and model dims are aligned to avoid rebuilds.
