# ⚠️  DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE
#
# This file is deprecated as of 2025-10-13.
# All dependencies are now managed in pyproject.toml (PEP 621 standard).
#
# ==============================================================================
# MIGRATION GUIDE
# ==============================================================================
#
# OLD (DEPRECATED):
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# NEW (RECOMMENDED):
#   pip install -e .              # Install production dependencies
#   pip install -e ".[dev]"       # Install dev dependencies (pytest, ruff, etc.)
#
# Or use the project Makefile:
#   make setup                    # Complete environment setup (includes GPU)
#
# ==============================================================================
# WHY THIS CHANGE?
# ==============================================================================
#
# 1. Modern Python Standard (PEP 621):
#    - pyproject.toml is the official standard for Python project metadata
#    - Single source of truth for dependencies
#
# 2. Better Dependency Management:
#    - No duplicate dependency lists
#    - Automatic version conflict resolution
#    - Optional dependency groups ([dev], [docs], etc.)
#
# 3. Reduced Maintenance:
#    - One file to maintain instead of two
#    - Less chance of version mismatches
#
# ==============================================================================
# GPU DEPENDENCIES (RAPIDS)
# ==============================================================================
#
# GPU packages (CuPy, cuDF, cuGraph, RMM) are NOT in pyproject.toml because:
# - They require specific CUDA versions
# - They have special installation procedures
# - They are installed separately in `make setup` Step 5
#
# Manual installation (if needed):
#   pip install cupy-cuda12x
#   pip install --extra-index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com \
#       cudf-cu12==24.12.0 \
#       cugraph-cu12==24.12.0 \
#       rmm-cu12==24.12.0
#   pip uninstall -y numba-cuda  # Remove conflicts
#
# ==============================================================================
#
# For historical reference, the old requirements.txt has been saved to:
#   requirements.txt.deprecated
