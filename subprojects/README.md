Subprojects for alternative training approaches

This directory hosts focused, opt‑in experiments that reuse the existing dataset and training code without disrupting the main pipeline.

Available subprojects:
- cs_ranking: Cross‑sectional day‑ranking training (Pairwise + RankIC focus)

Each subproject includes a small README and runnable scripts that wrap the existing training pipeline with targeted settings.
