Feature Specification for Multi-Horizon Stock
Return Model
Below is a comprehensive list of predictive features derived from J-Quants API data, structured for direct
implementation in a multi-horizon (1d, 5d, 10d, 20d) stock return regression pipeline. Each feature entry
includes the feature name, type, data source (J-Quants API endpoint and fields), calculation method,
data alignment strategy, justification (theoretical/empirical rationale with citations), and implementation
priority.


Price & Technical Indicators
      • Previous Day Price Return (1-day Momentum/Reversal)
      • Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, stock-specific)
      • Source: /prices/daily_quotes – uses prior day’s close and current day’s close price fields.
                             Closet −Closet−1
      • Calculation: rt,1d =     Close        (one trading day percentage return). Use adjusted prices for
                                     t−1

        corporate actions.
      • Alignment: Computed at end of day t, used as a feature from day t+1 onward (T+1, i.e. next
        trading day’s prediction input). No interpolation needed – naturally daily.
      • Justification: Captures short-term return reversal vs. momentum. Short-horizon stock returns
        often exhibit a reversal effect: stocks with large negative returns one day tend to bounce back over
        the next few days, and vice versa 1 . This “short-term reversal” anomaly is well-documented (≈
       +2%/month strategy profit)    1     . However, if the price move was driven by fundamental news (e.g.
       earnings), continuation (momentum) can occur instead         2   . Thus, previous-day return is a strong
       predictor, especially when combined with event indicators (to distinguish news-driven moves
       from noise).

      • Priority: High – Critical for 1–5 day horizon performance (strong empirical predictive power).


      • 5-Day Price Return (1-week Momentum/Reversion)


      • Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, stock-specific)
      • Source: /prices/daily_quotes – uses close prices from the last 5 trading days.
                             Closet −Closet−5
      • Calculation: rt,5d =     Close        (5-trading-day cumulative return). For incomplete weeks
                                     t−5

        (around holidays), use last 5 available trading days.
      • Alignment: Calculated at end of day t, using data up to t. Used from day t+1 onward. No special
        interpolation (rolling window naturally shifts daily).
      • Justification: Captures short-term price trend or reversal over ~1 week. Short-horizon returns
        often mean-revert, but momentum can emerge if trends persist beyond a day. Empirical studies
        show weekly return reversals, especially in large stocks 3 . However, reversal strength declines
       when stocks have high turnover (liquid stocks with heavy trading can exhibit momentum instead)
        4 . This feature, combined with volume/turnover features, helps distinguish pure reversal

       signals from sustained momentum.

      • Priority: High – Important for 5-day ahead predictions; moderate effect on 1-day horizon but
        contributes to multi-day trend capture.




                                                        1
• 20-Day Price Return (1-month Momentum)


• Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, stock-specific)
• Source: /prices/daily_quotes – uses close prices ~20 trading days apart.
                        Closet −Closet−20
• Calculation: rt,20d =     Close         (20-day cumulative return, ~1 calendar month). Use last 20
                                t−20

  trading days.
• Alignment: Calculated at end of day t (uses up to day t close), available from day t+1. For newly
  listed stocks with <20 days data, use available history (or set null).
• Justification: Captures medium-term momentum or reversal. Momentum effects are strongest at
  intermediate horizons (3–12 months), but even 1-month trends can influence short-term returns.
  For example, stocks near their 1-month high may continue to rise (short-term momentum), while
  those with extreme 1-month moves might pull back (mean reversion). Including a 20-day trend
  helps the model differentiate sustained momentum from very short-lived moves. It also overlaps
  with the “52-week high” effect (stocks near annual highs tend to keep rising short-term) 4 .

• Priority: Medium – Adds context for 10–20d horizon forecasts and cross-sectional momentum;
 less critical than 1d/5d returns for ultra-short term.


• Price Distance from Moving Average (20-day z-score)


• Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, stock-specific)
• Source: /prices/daily_quotes – uses close price; compute 20-day moving average and standard
  deviation.
                            Closet −MA20,t
• Calculation: Z-scoret =        σ20,t     , where MA${20,t}$ is the 20-day moving average of close
  prices and $\sigma$ is the 20-day std. deviation. (Can also compute a 5-day variant similarly.)
• Alignment: Computed at end of day t using last 20 days, used from t+1. Forward-fill on days
  without new price (non-trading days) is not needed if using trading days only.
• Justification: Measures how extreme the current price is relative to recent history (a technical
  “Bollinger band” style indicator). An extreme positive z-score means the stock is far above its
  recent average – often an overbought signal that may precede short-term mean reversion. An
  extreme negative z-score indicates oversold conditions that could lead to a bounce. By
  normalizing, this feature is comparable across stocks and time. It directly quantifies short-term
  overreaction or breakout conditions; such extremes often correct or revert in the ensuing days
  absent new information (consistent with short-term reversal patterns 2 ).

• Priority: Medium – Useful for detecting overbought/oversold states (especially 1–10d horizons),
  but somewhat redundant with recent return features. Include for robustness.


• Intraday vs. Overnight Returns (Open/Close Decomposition)


• Type: Two continuous numeric features (time-series, stock-specific)
• Source: /prices/daily_quotes – uses daily open and close prices (and previous close for
  overnight).
                                        Opent −Closet−1                           Closet −Opent
• Calculation: Overnight return: rtON =    Close        ; Intraday return: rtID =     Open      . These
                                                    t−1                                   t
  sum to the total daily return.
• Alignment: Both computed for day t after market close. Overnight return uses information from
  post-market and pre-market moves (e.g. global market influence), intraday return captures
  within-day momentum. Use as features on day t+1.
• Justification: Separating overnight vs. intraday performance provides insight into return drivers.
  Overnight returns often reflect news and global sentiment that emerged when local markets
  were closed, whereas intraday returns reflect price movement given that opening level. Patterns



                                                2
 in these can be predictive: e.g. a strong overnight gap up followed by intraday sell-off could
 indicate bullish news met with profit-taking, often leading to short-term weakness next day.
 Conversely, a flat overnight and strong intraday rally might signal genuine buying interest likely to
 carry into subsequent days. Research shows that overnight price dynamics differ from intraday
 (e.g. U.S. equities have historically earned most returns overnight, with day session often flat or
 reversing) 5 6 . These features let the model capture such effects in the Japanese market
 context.

• Priority: Medium – Adds nuance for 1d predictions (if model runs after close, these are fully
 known). Useful for distinguishing gap-driven moves from intraday momentum.


• High–Low Range Percent (Daily Volatility)


• Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, stock-specific)
• Source: /prices/daily_quotes – uses daily high and low price fields (and optionally close).
                             Hight −Lowt
• Calculation: RangePctt =      Close    , the day’s intraday range as a percentage of closing price.
                                       t
  Can also use true range (max of High-Low, |High - prevClose|, |Low - prevClose|) for gap-adjusted
  range.
• Alignment: Computed at end of day t, used from t+1. No further alignment needed.
• Justification: Intraday range is a proxy for realized volatility on that day. A large range indicates
  high uncertainty or information flow. Unusually high volatility often mean-reverts (volatility
  clustering: a volatility spike may predict elevated risk short-term but also potential reversal as
  extreme moves settle). Empirically, stocks with extreme high recent volatility tend to
  underperform going forward (the “volatility effect”) 7 , possibly because high-volatility episodes
 are associated with price drops and risk-aversion. Including range percent helps capture short-
 term volatility shocks that could foretell either continued turbulence or a corrective rebound.

• Priority: Medium – Important for short-term risk/volatility outlook (1–5d). Could be derived from
  other vol features; include for direct signal of volatility spikes.


• 5-Day Realized Volatility (Short-term Volatility)


• Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, stock-specific)
• Source: /prices/daily_quotes – uses past daily returns (close-to-close) over last 5 trading days.
• Calculation: σ   = 1∑
                             t
                                  (r )2 (sample standard deviation of last 5 daily returns).
                t,5d       5   i=t−4   i
  Alternatively use Parkinson’s high-low estimator for higher precision using intraday range.
  Normalize by annualizing if needed (not necessary for relative comparisons).
• Alignment: Computed at end of day t (using returns up to day t), feature from t+1. Use an as-of
  join: if a trading break occurs, still use last 5 trading days available.
• Justification: Measures very recent price volatility. High short-term volatility often persists
  (volatility clustering), indicating uncertain conditions likely to continue in the next few days. As a
  predictor, higher recent volatility can signal lower next-period returns on average (investors
  demand a premium or reduce positions) 7 . Also, sudden volatility bursts can indicate
 overreaction that corrects (coupling with reversal signals). Thus, 5-day vol provides a gauge of
 current risk and potential mean-reversion.

• Priority: High – Emphasized for short-term forecasts; directly addresses the user’s focus on
  “short-term volatility” signals.


• 20-Day Realized Volatility (Intermediate Volatility)




                                                 3
   • Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, stock-specific)
   • Source: /prices/daily_quotes – uses past 20 days of returns.
   • Calculation: σ    =    1
                               ∑
                                  t
                                       (r )2 . (Standard deviation of daily returns over ~1 month.)
                    t,20d      20     i=t−19   i
   • Alignment: Computed at end of day t, used from t+1 onward.
   • Justification: Captures a slightly longer volatility trend. This helps normalize short-term volatility
     against a baseline. For example, if 5-day vol is high but 20-day vol is also high, volatility is
     persistently elevated (perhaps due to a regime or sector-wide factor); if 5-day vol spikes far above
     20-day, it’s a more transient shock. By also including 20d vol, the model can infer a volatility
     mean-reversion factor or persistent risk factor. High 20-day volatility is often associated with
     riskier stocks which on average yield lower future returns (idiosyncratic volatility anomaly 7 ).

   • Priority: Medium – Useful for context and for features like volatility spike index; less directly
     predictive than 5-day vol for immediate moves.


   • Volatility Spike Index (Volatility Jump vs. Normal)


   • Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, stock-specific)
   • Source: Derived from 5d and 20d vol features (no new data required).
                                σ
   • Calculation: VolSpiket = σ t,5d (ratio of short-term vol to month-long vol). Optionally winsorize
                                    t,20d

     extreme values.
   • Alignment: Computed end of day t from vols at t, available from t+1. If 20d window not fully
     available, handle via shorter window or set null initially.
   • Justification: Highlights unusually high recent volatility relative to the stock’s typical volatility. A
     VolSpike >> 1 means a volatility shock – often accompanying news or market stress – which can
     predict short-term mean reversion as markets calm or persistent risk if regime changed.
     Conversely, a low ratio (<1) means recent trading is calmer than normal, possibly preceding a
     volatility pickup. This feature encapsulates the concept of volatility mean-reversion (volatility
     tends to revert to a baseline). It is also a proxy for recent uncertainty that might be resolved in
     coming days.
   • Priority: Medium – Captures a nuanced volatility signal (especially valuable for 5–20d forecasts).
     Can be derived, but listing explicitly for clarity.


Volume & Liquidity Indicators
   • Trading Volume (Relative to Average)
   • Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, stock-specific)
   • Source: /prices/daily_quotes – volume field (number of shares traded). Also uses a rolling
     average (e.g. 20-day volume).
   • Calculation: Compute normalized volume: e.g. VolRelt = AVGVolume  t
                                                                  Volume    (current day volume
                                                                                20d,t

    divided by the stock’s 20-day average volume). Alternatively, use a z-score: (Volumet −
    Vol20 )/σ(Vol20 ) .
   • Alignment: Known at end of day t (daily total volume). Use as feature from t+1. The rolling
     average updates daily (forward-fill not needed except skip non-trading days).
   • Justification: Detects volume surges or droughts. A volume spike (VolRel >> 1) indicates unusual
     trading activity, often signifying informed trading or event-driven action. High volume confirms
     that a price move is backed by strong participation, which tends to validate trends (price moves
     on high volume are less likely to reverse immediately) 8 . Conversely, a large price change on low
    volume may be unreliable and more prone to reversal. Thus, volume relative to normal is a key
    contextual feature: e.g. a +5% return on 5× normal volume is a stronger bullish signal (likely
    momentum) than +5% on 0.2× volume (which might revert). Empirical studies find short-term




                                                    4
 reversals are weaker (or turn into momentum) when turnover is high           4   , implying volume
 moderates the reversal effect.

• Priority: High – Essential for interpreting price signals (1–5d horizons). Include both raw volume
  and a normalized variant for scale invariance.


• Turnover Rate (Volume as % of Float)


• Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, stock-specific)
• Source: /prices/daily_quotes – volume; /listed/info – shares outstanding or float (if
  provided).
                             Volumet
• Calculation: Turnovert = Shares Out (daily trading volume divided by total shares outstanding,
                                        t
  yielding a percentage of the company’s shares traded). If float (free float shares) is available, use
  that for better accuracy; otherwise total shares gives an approximate turnover. A normalized
  version can be the turnover relative to its 20-day average.
• Alignment: Calculate at end of day t; use from t+1. Shares outstanding from listed/info is static
  or changes only on corporate actions (treat as constant in short term, as-of joined from latest
  info).
• Justification: Standardizes volume by company size. This distinguishes whether a high volume (in
  absolute terms) is truly significant for that stock. Turnover is linked to liquidity and investor
  attention. Extremely high turnover (a large % of shares changing hands) can indicate panicked
  selling or speculative buying, often short-lived. Low turnover suggests a stock is relatively
  illiquid or off radar, which can mean larger volatility per unit volume (captured by Amihud
  illiquidity below). Also, short-term reversal strategies have been found to yield lower profits in
  high-turnover stocks (as those moves are more likely information-driven) 4 . Including turnover
 helps the model adjust signals for liquidity differences – e.g. a small-cap stock with 1% of shares
 traded (high engagement) might react differently than a mega-cap with 0.01% traded.

• Priority: High – Important for cross-sectional comparability and for features like volume spikes
  and liquidity effects.


• Amihud Illiquidity Indicator (Price Impact of Volume)


• Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, stock-specific)
• Source: /prices/daily_quotes – daily volume (in shares) and value (if available; if not, can
  approximate value = volume * price); daily return.
                                   ∣r ∣
• Calculation: Illiquidityt = Tradingt Value , where trading value = volume * price (in ¥). Usually
                                            t
                                                    1      20   ∣r   ∣
 averaged over a period, e.g. use the past 20 days: 20 ∑i=1 Value
                                                               t−i
                                                                           . This gives the classic Amihud
                                                                     t−i

  illiquidity: how much price moves per unit of trading value (higher = more illiquid). We can also
  compute a 5-day version for short term.
• Alignment: If using a 20-day average, compute at end of day t using data up to t, feature from t+1.
  For daily (instantaneous) illiquidity, compute each day’s ratio as well.
• Justification: This feature measures price impact – how sensitive the stock’s price is to trading
  volume. Highly illiquid stocks (high Amihud values) have outsized return moves on relatively little
  volume, indicating limited liquidity. Such stocks often exhibit stronger reversals and
  idiosyncratic volatility. Also, large institutional flows avoid illiquid names, so persistent order
  imbalances can move these prices dramatically (and then mean-revert). By including illiquidity,
  the model can assess whether a recent price jump is significant: in an illiquid stock, a big jump
  might be noise (likely to revert), whereas in a very liquid stock, a jump is more likely due to
  fundamental news. Illiquidity has been shown to predict cross-sectional returns (investors




                                                5
    demand higher returns for illiquid stocks) and to differentiate how stocks respond to volume and
    volatility shocks 9 10 .

   • Priority: Medium – Improves model’s understanding of liquidity conditions (robustness), but not
     as directly predictive as volume/turnover for short-term returns.


   • Volume-Price Trend Indicator (Price & Volume Interaction)


   • Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, stock-specific)
   • Source: Derived from price and volume features above (no new data; uses recent returns and
     volume).
                                                                                        AVG Vol
   • Calculation: One example: Volume-Weighted Momentum – VWMOMt = rt,5d × AVG Vol t,5d .
                                                                                                      t,20d

    This scales recent return by the volume spike over the same period. Alternatively, use a Price-
    Volume Trend measure: cumulative sum of ΔPrice × Volume (used in some technical analysis
     as a confirmation indicator). We can also include simpler interactions: e.g. Up/Down on high
     volume flags.
   • Alignment: Calculated at end of day t, using volumes/returns up to t. Use from t+1.
   • Justification: Combines price momentum with volume confirmation. A rising price accompanied
     by rising volume is a stronger bullish signal than a rise on declining volume 8 . This feature gives
    the model an integrated view: if 5-day return is positive and volume has been above average, the
    feature will be strongly positive (signaling momentum likely to continue); if 5-day return is
    positive but volume was weak, the indicator will be weaker or negative (implying a suspect rally
    likely to revert). Similarly for downtrends: price drop on high volume suggests genuine selling
    pressure (likely to persist or need significant news to reverse), whereas a price drop on low
    volume might reverse quickly. This aligns with the principle that volume confirms price
    movements 11 .

   • Priority: Medium – Captures a nuanced predictive signal (trend confirmation vs. divergence). It’s
     effectively an engineered feature from others; include if complexity is manageable for the
     pipeline.


   • Bid-Ask Spread (Proxy) – if data available


   • Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, stock-specific)
   • Source: If intraday or quote data is available (not explicitly listed in J-Quants basic endpoints).
     Otherwise, a proxy can be estimated from high/low or close/open (higher volatility in prices
     relative to trading range can imply wider spreads).
                                                                   Hight −Lowt
   • Calculation: E.g. use high vs. low vs. close: PctSpreadt ≈       Closet   − RangePctt to isolate
     gap beyond pure volatility. If order book data were available, use quoted bid-ask.
   • Alignment: Measured daily; if using OHLC proxy, computed at end of day t.
   • Justification: The bid-ask spread reflects transaction cost and liquidity. A widening spread
     indicates lower liquidity and higher uncertainty. In the short term, very large spreads might
     predict higher volatility and potential price jumps (as a liquidity event). However, due to data
     limitations, this is a low-priority proxy feature.
   • Priority: Low – Include only if easily derived; otherwise skip, as other liquidity features cover
     similar ground.


Sentiment & Positioning Indicators
   • Sector Short-Selling Ratio
   • Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, sector-level; mapped to each stock by sector)




                                                   6
• Source: /markets/short_selling (short selling ratio by sector). This provides the percentage of
  trading value attributable to short-selling for each sector (likely daily). Also require each stock’s
  sector code from /listed/info to map the appropriate ratio.
• Calculation: For a stock with sector S, feature = short_sell_ratio<S>_% on day t. If the API
  provides short-selling ratio as e.g. 20% for sector, use 0.20 as the value. Optionally, one can
  normalize: subtract the average or compute a z-score relative to that sector’s history to highlight
  unusually high shorting days.
• Alignment: The short-selling ratio is presumably published daily after market close. Use a T+1
  alignment (feature on day t+1 reflecting day t’s ratio) if there’s a reporting delay. If provided in
  real-time daily, can use same day. Typically assume it’s end-of-day statistic, so include from next
  trading day. No interpolation – value stays until updated next trading day.
• Justification: This gauges bearish sentiment and positioning in the stock’s industry. A high
  sector short-selling ratio means a large fraction of trades in that sector were short sales, indicating
  widespread bearish bets or hedging in that sector. Empirical evidence shows that stocks with high
  short interest (i.e. heavy short selling) tend to underperform subsequently 12 , as short sellers
 often possess negative information. By extension, if an entire sector faces heavy shorting, it could
 signal negative outlook or overvaluation for that sector, pressuring constituent stocks’ short-term
 returns. Alternatively, extremely high shorting can set the stage for short-covering rallies if
 sentiment shifts. In either case, the ratio provides a predictive signal: rising shorting activity often
 precedes price declines 13 (information content of shorts), whereas an abnormally high short
 ratio reaching extremes could mark capitulation (contrarian buy signal). Including this feature
 helps capture broad positioning trends affecting the stock beyond its own fundamentals.

• Priority: High – Valuable sentiment indicator, especially for 5–20d predictions or during market
  stress. High priority due to strong theoretical impact of short positioning.


• Stock-Specific Short Interest (Short Positions Outstanding)


• Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, stock-specific)
• Source: /markets/daily_margin_interest – daily margin trading balances, which include margin
  short sell balance (shares sold short on margin) for each stock; or /markets/
  short_selling_positions if available (reported short positions ≥ certain threshold). Also need
  shares outstanding from /listed/info for normalization.
• Calculation: Compute short interest ratio: ShortIntt = ShortShares
                                                              Shares Out (fraction of float that is short
                                                                        t


 via margin). Also useful is days-to-cover: AvgShortSharest
                                               Daily Volume          (number of days of normal volume to
                                                               20d
 cover all shorts). We can include either or both. Changes in short interest (week-over-week
 percent change) can be another variant.
• Alignment: Margin short balance is typically reported end-of-day (possibly with T+1 publication
  delay). Use an as-of join: i.e. use the latest available short interest as of the prediction date. If daily
  data is promptly updated, use yesterday’s figure for today’s prediction (T+1). If only weekly, then
  apply the last known value to all days until a new update (a step function over time).
• Justification: Short interest is a direct measure of bearish bets on the stock. High short interest
  has strong predictive power: stocks with unusually high short interest often experience negative
  abnormal returns subsequently, as short sellers’ information on overvaluation or bad news tends
  to be proven correct 12 . Additionally, short interest increases ahead of negative fundamentals
 (shorts anticipate bad earnings surprises) 14 . Thus, a high or rising ShortInt is generally a bearish
 signal (priority to fundamental-based down moves). However, extremely high short interest can
 also imply a potential short squeeze scenario if positive news forces shorts to cover, causing
 sharp short-term rallies. Our model can account for this by also considering momentum and event
 features (e.g. if short interest is high and an unexpected good news arrives, the upside can be




                                                  7
 dramatic). Overall, including short interest helps capture informational inefficiencies and
 sentiment at the stock level.

• Priority: High – Key positioning indicator for robustness and for 10–20d forecasts (short interest
  data may move slowly, but its predictive effect is significant).


• Margin Trading Balance (Long vs Short Demand)


• Type: Two continuous numeric features (time-series, stock-specific)
• Source: /markets/daily_margin_interest – provides margin buy balance (outstanding long
  positions on margin credit) and margin sell balance (outstanding short positions) for each stock.
  If only weekly data available from /markets/weekly_margin_interest , use that with interpolation.
• Calculation: We derive: Margin Long Ratio = MarginBuyBalance / Market Cap (or / Shares Out) —
  proportion of the stock’s float bought on credit; Margin Short Ratio = MarginSellBalance / Market
  Cap — proportion sold short via margin. Also consider Margin Long-Short difference or ratio =
  MarginBuy / MarginSell as an indicator of net retail positioning. Changes in these balances week-
  to-week can also be features (e.g. surge in margin buying this week).
• Alignment: The balance data is typically reported for end-of-day (with possible next-day release).
  Use as-of join: the latest known balances as of each date (if daily, use yesterday’s for today; if
  weekly, use the last week’s value for all days until updated). Interpolate daily values if needed (e.g.
  assume constant within the week).
• Justification: Margin balances reflect retail investor sentiment and leverage. High margin buy
  balance means many investors have taken leveraged long positions, which can signal optimism or
 speculation. In the short term, a rapid increase in margin buying often happens in rising markets
 but can precede price corrections if those positions become pressured (e.g. margin calls can
 exacerbate down moves). Conversely, high margin short balance (similarly to short interest)
 indicates significant bearish bets. The ratio of margin longs to shorts can be seen as a bull/bear
 sentiment gauge among retail leveraged traders. Extreme values may be contrarian indicators:
 e.g. if margin longs are at record highs, the buying capacity might be exhausted (bearish); if
 margin shorts are at highs, any positive catalyst can trigger short covering (bullish potential).
 Including these features makes the model aware of positioning risk – stocks heavily bought on
 margin can face forced selling, while heavily shorted stocks can rally on short covering. These are
 especially relevant for short-term volatility and reversals around market turning points.

• Priority: Medium – Useful for robustness (particularly in speculative environments). Medium
  priority due to slower-moving nature, but can materially improve 10–20d forecast accuracy in
  volatile periods.


• Net Foreign Buying (Market-Level)


• Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, market-wide; same value applies to all stocks for that day,
  or perhaps segmented by market section)
• Source: /markets/trades_spec – investment division info. If this dataset provides daily net
  purchase amount by investor type (e.g. foreign investors) for the market or exchange section, use
  the foreign net flow. (If only weekly data is available, use weekly values applied on that week’s end
  or spread across days.)
• Calculation: Use the net value (in JPY) of foreign investor stock purchases minus sales on day t
  (for TSE overall or relevant section). Possibly normalize by total market volume to get a
  percentage flow, or by market index level. For implementation, one could create an indicator like
  “foreign flow in billions of JPY”. If multiple categories (domestic institutions, individuals, etc.) are
  available, features can be created for each, though foreign is often most impactful.




                                                 8
• Alignment: If daily, use the value from day t as a feature on day t+1 (assuming data confirmed by
  next day). If only weekly, apply the latest weekly net flow as of the current date (e.g. use the last
  reported week’s flow until a new report). Ensure no look-ahead bias (e.g. if weekly released on
  Wednesday for prior week, only use it from that day onward).
• Justification: Investor flows influence short-term price dynamics. In Japan’s market, foreign
  investors’ net buying or selling is a well-known driver of index movement and liquidity 15 . A large
 positive foreign inflow indicates broad optimism and often correlates with near-term price
 strength in many stocks (a rising tide lifting boats), whereas heavy foreign outflows can presage
 short-term market weakness. This feature acts as a proxy for market sentiment and fund flows.
 It’s effectively a market-level exogenous factor that can help explain why all stocks might have an
 upward or downward bias on certain days regardless of individual fundamentals. By including it,
 the model can adjust predictions if, say, there’s strong market-wide buying interest that could
 buoy even weaker stocks in the short run. (If trades_spec has per-stock breakdown by investor,
 even better – then use stock-specific foreign net volume as a percent of that stock’s volume, which
 would be a very direct flow signal. But absent that, the aggregate still provides signal.)

• Priority: Medium – Enhances robustness and captures macro sentiment for 1–5 day forecasts.
  Not stock-specific, but important in broad market moves. Include if data available.


• Investor Type Rotation Indicators – optional, if trades_spec granular


• Type: Continuous numeric or categorical (time-series, stock or market segment)
• Source: /markets/trades_spec – if it gives breakdown by investor type (foreign, institutional,
  retail, proprietary) at the stock or segment level.
• Calculation: e.g. Retail vs Institutional Flow Balance – difference between retail net buy and
  institutional net buy (could be market-wide or per stock if available). Or indicator flags like
  “Foreign heavy buying today” (if foreign net flow ranks high percentile). These could be simplified
  to dummy signals or continuous values of net flows.
• Alignment: Same as above – daily or weekly as reported.
• Justification: Different investor classes often exhibit distinct behaviors. For instance, retail
  investors might chase momentum or mean-reversion differently than institutions. If retail is
  aggressively buying while institutions are selling, it might signal unsustainable rallies (smart
  money selling into retail demand). Conversely, strong institutional accumulation could predict
  sustained upward movement. Such features refine the sentiment aspect by identifying who is
  driving the price. They are event-like (when a big shift occurs) and time-series.

• Priority: Low (if per-stock data isn’t available) or Medium (if available and known to be
  impactful). It adds complexity and might be omitted if data is only aggregate.


• Day-of-Week & Seasonality (Calendar Effects)


• Type: Categorical (one-hot encoded for Monday, Tuesday, …) or binary flags; Continuous (e.g. day
  index for cyclical pattern)
• Source: /markets/trading_calendar – provides trading days and holidays. (For day-of-week, no
  external data needed beyond date.)
• Calculation: For each day, generate features: e.g. Monday=1 if day is Monday else 0 (similarly for
  Tue-Fri). Alternatively, a single categorical feature “DayOfWeek”. Also consider end-of-month or
  pre-holiday flags (if the day before a long weekend).
• Alignment: These are known in advance (calendar-based). No alignment issues. Apply to each
  date as appropriate.




                                               9
   • Justification: There are mild but persistent calendar anomalies in stock returns (though weaker
     in recent years). Historically, Mondays often show lower or negative returns (possibly due to
     accumulation of bad news over weekend), while Fridays and pre-holidays can have positive bias
     (optimism heading into time off). Including day-of-week can capture any such systematic effect in
     the data, improving predictability of the mean return. Also, turning-of-month effects (first few
     days of month tend to be strong due to fund inflows) could be captured if needed. While these
     effects are small, they add a bit of predictive power and help the model not to erroneously
     attribute a pattern to other features.
   • Priority: Low – Minor contribution, but easy to implement. Can be included for completeness
     (robustness and slight edge in 1-day forecasts).


Derivatives & Market Context Indicators
   • Market Index Return (TOPIX or Nikkei)
   • Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, market-level)
   • Source: /indices/topix – TOPIX index OHLC (or /indices for other indices like Nikkei 225 if
     needed). Use index closing values.
                                               IndexCloset −IndexCloset−1
   • Calculation: Daily market return: rtmkt =       IndexClose           . Optionally include 5-day index
                                                                t−1

     return as well.
   • Alignment: Known at end of day t. Use from t+1. (For predicting next-day stock returns, one could
     also include same-day index return as a contemporaneous factor if modeling close-to-close
     relationships jointly, but typically we use prior index moves as features.)
   • Justification: Captures market-wide movements and beta exposure. A large portion of a stock’s
     daily move is often driven by market (or sector) factors. Including the recent index return helps
     the model account for broad market momentum or reversal that could influence all stocks. For
     example, if the market had a strong rally in the last few days, some mean-reversion at the market
     level might occur (affecting most stocks’ direction). Conversely, a market in steady uptrend can lift
     stocks (market momentum). By providing the index trend, we allow the model to separate market
     effects from stock-specific alpha signals. It effectively normalizes stock momentum vs. the market:
     e.g. a stock up +2% when the market is up +3% is actually relatively weak. We can enhance this by
     also adding a stock’s excess return vs market if desired (stock return minus index return).

   • Priority: High – Crucial context feature for all horizons (improves robustness and prevents the
     model from needing to learn market moves via many individual stocks’ behavior).


   • Sector Index Return


   • Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, sector-level mapped to stock)
   • Source: /indices – If sector indices (e.g. TOPIX 17 industries or 33 industries indices) are
     available via the indices endpoint (by index code). Alternatively, compute average return of all
     stocks in the sector from daily_quotes (though official index is preferred).
   • Calculation: Similar to market return, but for the stock’s specific sector index. rtsect (S) = return of
     sector S on day t. Can include 5-day sector return as well.
   • Alignment: End-of-day t computation, available from t+1 for features.
   • Justification: Provides sector-specific momentum/reversal context. Some price movements
     are sector-driven (oil price up => oil sector rally, etc.). Including sector return helps explain stock
     moves due to industry trends. It also allows for features like relative strength: e.g. the model can
     combine stock’s return and sector return to identify if a stock is outperforming or
     underperforming its peers. Empirically, stocks that strongly outperform their sector in the short
     run might revert (if it was an idiosyncratic overshoot), whereas stocks that lag a strong sector rally
     might catch up. Additionally, sector momentum itself can persist or reverse: having the sector




                                                   10
 trend as a feature lets the model learn these patterns (some sectors exhibit momentum, others
 mean-reversion in certain regimes).

• Priority: Medium – Improves cross-sectional predictions and captures industry effects (especially
  valuable for 5–20d). Include if data readily available.


• Futures Basis (Index Futures vs Spot)


• Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, market-level)
• Source: /derivatives/futures – index futures quotes (e.g. Nikkei 225 futures front-month); /
  indices for index level.
• Calculation: Basist = FuturesPrice t −IndexPricet
                               IndexPrice           , using near-month futures closing price and index
                                          t
  closing level on the same day. If multiple maturities, use nearest expiration for short-term signal.
  Can also compute change in basis from yesterday.
• Alignment: Futures price at end of day t (which might reflect trading up to early evening if JPX
  night session considered). Use as feature from t+1. If using night session prices (beyond cash
  market close), be careful to not include information that wouldn’t be known by model at cutoff
  (unless model runs post-night session). Ideally, use basis as of the cash market close (futures price
  synchronized with 3pm close).
• Justification: The futures basis reflects expectations and hedging pressure. A rich (high
  positive) basis could indicate optimistic outlook or positive carry (low risk-free rate), whereas a
  negative basis (backwardation) often occurs in times of market stress or heavy shorting of
  futures (paying a premium to hedge). Unusual basis levels can predict short-term corrections: for
 instance, a significantly negative basis might presage a near-term rebound (as it signals extreme
 bearish sentiment and demand for hedges), while an excessively positive basis might predict
 pullback (market over-eagerness). This feature effectively captures the derivatives market
 sentiment relative to spot. It’s a subtle signal but can be powerful around turning points.

• Priority: Low – Advanced feature; include if implementation is easy and data timing is handled. Its
  predictive value is episodic (most useful in extremes).


• Index Implied Volatility (Nikkei 225 Option IV)


• Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, market-level)
• Source: /option/index_option – Nikkei 225 option quotes; possibly provides implied vol or
  enough data to compute. If not directly given, use option prices to derive a 30-day ATM implied
  volatility (analogous to VIX for Nikkei). Alternatively, if not feasible, skip or use a proxy like
  historical vol of index as substitute.
• Calculation: Calculate implied volatility from near-the-money options: e.g. take the at-the-money
  call and put prices for the front month, use the Black-Scholes formula with known strike,
  underlying (Nikkei index), time to expiration, and risk-free rate to solve for implied vol. Or, if
  “theoretical price” and “settlement price” are given, the API might directly provide an implied
  volatility metric. Use that as the feature (in % volatility).
• Alignment: Implied vol index for end of day t (the option’s closing implied vol or official closing
  VIX-like measure). Use from t+1. During non-trading days, carry forward last value or compute
  from any off-session if available.
• Justification: Implied volatility is the market’s expectation of future volatility and a proxy for
  investor fear or complacency. A spike in implied volatility (like a VIX spike) usually coincides with
  market drops and panic. High implied vol levels often predict mean-reverting positive returns
  (markets tend to rebound after peak fear subsides) – in other words, extremely high volatility is
  often followed by market gains as fear recedes 16 . Conversely, very low implied vol may precede




                                               11
 weak returns or sudden spikes (complacency before the storm). By including an implied volatility
 measure, the model can incorporate this risk sentiment factor. It helps adjust expectations for
 stocks: in high-vol regimes, even fundamentally strong stocks can drop, but also the rebound
 potential is larger. For short-term forecasting, changes in implied vol can signal shifts in regime
 that affect all stocks’ volatility and direction (e.g. rising vol often pairs with momentum crashes or
 reversals).

• Priority: Medium – A macro-level feature focusing on volatility forecasting. Medium priority
  because it’s not stock-specific, but it adds predictive power during volatile periods (important for
  1d-5d risk-sensitive forecasts).


• Put/Call Open Interest Ratio – if data available


• Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, market-level or index-level)
• Source: /derivatives/options – if it includes open interest or volume for calls and puts on the
  index. If not directly available, this feature may be skipped.
                            Total Put OI
• Calculation: PCRt = Total       Call OI for nearest expiry, or volume-based ratio of put vs call trading.
  Smooth it over a few days to reduce noise.
• Alignment: Compute at end of day t, use from t+1.
• Justification: The put/call ratio is a classic sentiment indicator. A high PCR (more puts than
  calls) suggests bearish sentiment or demand for protection, which at extremes can be contrarian
  bullish (everyone is hedged/pessimistic) or indicative of informed negative outlook. A low PCR
  (call-dominated) indicates bullish speculation, which at extreme can warn of overbought
 conditions. Including PCR can improve short-term market timing within the model, particularly for
 5–20 day horizons where sentiment mean-reversion plays out.

• Priority: Low – Include if readily accessible; otherwise skip, as implied vol and short interest cover
  similar sentiment ground.


• Futures Trading Volume & Open Interest


• Type: Continuous numeric (time-series, market-level or contract-level)
• Source: /derivatives/futures – may include volume and OI for futures contracts.
• Calculation: Use change in open interest (ΔOI) on the index futures as a feature, and high futures
  volume days as a feature (flag or continuous). For example, a large increase in OI on a price move
  indicates new positions driving the move (can foreshadow trend continuation), whereas flat OI on
  a price move might indicate short covering or long liquidation (existing positions changing, more
  likely to mean-revert).
• Alignment: End of day t futures data, use from t+1.
• Justification: Derivatives flow: OI rising means money entering the market (new longs/shorts),
  often reinforcing trends; falling OI means money leaving (position closing), often happening
  during reversals. Unusual futures volume or OI changes can thus predict short-term trend
  persistence or reversal. For instance, if price rose and OI jumped, new longs likely entered –
  could sustain the rally short-term. If price rose but OI fell (short covering rally), the move might
  fade once shorts are done. This nuance from futures market activity complements the cash
  market signals.
• Priority: Low – More advanced and subtle; use if data is available and model can benefit from
  futures market context.




                                                 12
Fundamental & Event Indicators
   • Earnings Announcement Proximity
   • Type: Categorical/binary (event indicator) + continuous (countdown)
   • Source: /fins/announcement – earnings announcement schedule (upcoming announcement
     dates for each stock); /calendar/markets for date reference.
   • Calculation: Create features like: Upcoming Earnings in 5 Days (Y/N) – a binary flag that is 1 if
     the company will announce earnings within the next week (t to t+5 days); Days to Next Earnings –
     an integer or continuous countdown (e.g. 0 if today is announcement day, positive if days until
     next announcement, negative if days since last announcement). Also, Recent Earnings
     Announcement flag – 1 if an earnings release happened in the past N days (e.g. last 5 days).
   • Alignment: The schedule is known in advance. For upcoming announcements, mark the feature
     in the days leading up to the event (and on the event day). For past announcements, the feature
     becomes active on the day after the announcement (since the actual results are typically released
     after market close, treat the next trading day as the first day “post-earnings”). Use as-of join to
     ensure we don’t use the knowledge of an announcement before it’s officially scheduled.
   • Justification: Earnings releases are major events that drive volatility and returns. In the days
     before earnings, stocks often experience elevated volatility and speculative positioning (some
     investors buying ahead of expected good news or selling ahead of bad news). This can lead to
     mean-reverting moves if anticipation was wrong, or continuation if expectations are confirmed. A
     flag for upcoming earnings can help the model increase predicted volatility or be cautious in
     directional prediction. More importantly, after earnings, there is the well-known post-earnings
    announcement drift (PEAD): stocks with positive surprises tend to continue rising for days or
    weeks after the announcement, while those with negative surprises continue falling 5 6 . By
    including a recent announcement flag (and possibly the surprise magnitude as a feature – see
    next item), the model can capture earnings momentum. For example, if an earnings
    announcement (past 2 days) was very positive (price jumped), a PEAD-aware model will predict
    further outperformance short-term 5 . Without these event features, the model might incorrectly
    label the post-earnings jump as an outlier or pure mean-reversion candidate.

   • Priority: High – Critical for robustness around earnings dates and for capturing earnings
     momentum in 5-20d horizons.


   • Earnings Surprise / Revision Metrics


   • Type: Continuous numeric (event-derived, stock-specific)
   • Source: /fins/statements – financials (to get actual earnings or profit); external consensus data
     if available (not provided by J-Quants, but we may approximate surprise by price reaction or YoY
     growth). If no analyst estimate, use year-over-year EPS growth or earnings vs guidance if
     available, or price change on earnings day as a proxy for surprise.
   • Calculation: Example features: Earnings Day Return = stock’s return on the day after earnings
     announcement (market reaction); this serves as a proxy for surprise (positive if earnings beat
     expectations, negative if miss). Another: YoY Quarterly EPS Growth = (latest EPS – EPS from same
     quarter last year) / |last year’s EPS|. Also, Analyst Revision Count if data existed (not in provided
     API, likely skip or use price-based proxy). These would be updated only when new earnings are
     announced. The feature can be forward-filled until next announcement (indicating the last
     earnings surprise magnitude). Normalize surprises (e.g. divide by price or use standardized
     unexpected earnings if possible).
   • Alignment: Calculated after an earnings announcement is released. E.g., on the morning after
     earnings release, compute the surprise metrics and include them as features from that day
     forward. Use as-of join to keep the same surprise value until a new earnings report replaces it.




                                                  13
  Ensure not to use any info that wasn’t public at the time (no look-ahead of actual results pre-
  announcement).
• Justification: Quantifies earnings momentum. The magnitude of an earnings surprise is directly
  linked to PEAD: larger positive surprises yield stronger subsequent drift 6 . Including a numerical
 surprise feature (even if proxied by the earnings-day return) allows the model to scale its
 expectations: e.g. a mildly positive surprise might lead to a modest drift, while a huge positive
 surprise (stock up 15% on earnings) often continues to outperform significantly in the following
 weeks 5 6 . Similarly, big negative surprises predict continued underperformance as investors
 underreact initially. Even absent consensus data, the earnings-day return is a reliable indicator of
 the news’ positivity/negativity. Additionally, a feature like YoY growth or earnings revision (if
 available) captures fundamental momentum – companies with accelerating earnings tend to see
 upward price momentum, independent of immediate surprise. This ties into the concept that
 short-term returns are driven not just by technicals but by changes in fundamental expectations.

• Priority: High – Very important around earnings cycles and for 10–20d predictions (where drift
  plays out). High priority to accurately model event-driven moves.


• Analyst/Forecast Signals – if available via statements or external


• Type: Continuous numeric (event-derived, stock-specific)
• Source: /fins/statements and /fins/fs_details – sometimes includes company forecasts or
  revisions. If the API provides company’s projected earnings or analyst forecasts (not sure if
  included), then features can be built for earning forecast changes. If not, this can be skipped.
• Calculation: e.g. Guidance Surprise = Company’s new guidance vs prior guidance or vs analyst
  consensus (if one can derive it). Or simply Change in Operating Profit forecast quarter-over-
  quarter if the company issues forecasts. Mark significant positive or negative changes.
• Alignment: When new forecasts are announced (often at earnings), compute immediately and use
  from next day onward.
• Justification: Captures forward-looking earnings momentum. Oftentimes, stock moves are
  driven more by revised expectations than past results. If a company raises its earnings guidance,
  that is a strong positive signal that can drive continued stock strength (similar effect as a positive
  earnings surprise). By quantifying forecast changes, the model can better predict sustained moves
  beyond the initial announcement reaction.

• Priority: Medium – If data is available. Otherwise skip or consider low priority relative to other
  features.


• Dividend Events (Ex-dividend Indicator & Yield)


• Type: Binary (event flag) + continuous (yield)
• Source: /dividends/dividend – dividend info (ex-div dates, amounts); /prices/daily_quotes
  (price for yield calc).
• Calculation: Ex-Dividend Day flag = 1 if today is ex-dividend date for the stock (0 otherwise).
  Dividend Yield = annual dividends per share / price (perhaps not needed for short-term, but
  include for completeness or to adjust returns). If predicting raw returns, note that on ex-div day
  the price will drop by roughly the dividend amount – having a flag informs the model of this
  mechanical effect. One could also adjust the target return to be total return including dividend to
  avoid a need for the model to learn it. But if not, then this flag is essential.
• Alignment: The ex-div date is known beforehand from the calendar. Set the flag on the specific
  trading day that is ex-div. Dividend yield can be updated when dividend info is announced (usually
  well in advance or periodically).




                                               14
      • Justification: On ex-dividend dates, stock prices typically fall by the dividend amount. This is not
        a predictive signal per se, but a data adjustment issue – the model might otherwise interpret the
        ex-div price drop as a negative signal. Including an ex-div flag (and/or using dividend-adjusted
        returns for the target) ensures the model doesn’t wrongly attribute that drop to fundamentals or
        sentiment. Additionally, dividend yield as a feature (though more of a value factor) might have
        minor short-term effects: high-yield stocks could be more defensive (lower volatility), and around
        dividend times, some investors buy for yield (supporting the stock before ex-div and then selling
        after). These are secondary, but the main reason is robustness and correct modeling of those
        event days.

      • Priority: Medium – The ex-div flag is high priority for correctness (to avoid spurious model
        errors around those days). The dividend yield factor is low priority for predictive power in 1-20 day
        horizon (more relevant to longer-term), but can be included for completeness or multi-horizon
        consistency.


      • Corporate Actions & Other Events


      • Type: Binary flags (events)
      • Source: /listed/info might list stock splits, mergers; /fins/dividend for stock splits or /
        calendar/markets for special trading days. Possibly the API doesn’t explicitly list all corporate
        actions, but major ones like splits can be inferred from price adjustments.
      • Calculation: Flags for events like Stock Split day, Index inclusion/exclusion (if known), or
        Trading halts etc. These are rare but can cause abnormal returns around those dates.
      • Alignment: Known in advance (announcements) or as they occur.
      • Justification: To capture any out-of-ordinary events that could affect short-term returns or data
        consistency. For example, stock splits often see price increases before/after due to liquidity
        perceptions, or index inclusion can cause a temporary price pop due to fund buying. While these
        are not frequent, including them ensures the model accounts for such event-driven moves when
        they happen.
      • Priority: Low – These events are infrequent; handle them if convenient, but not critical to daily
        predictions.



Each feature above should be engineered into the model dataset with careful attention to alignment (to
avoid look-ahead bias) and appropriate normalization. For many continuous features, it’s advisable to
include a normalized variant: for example, a rolling z-score (time-series normalization) or a percentile
rank relative to the stock’s history. This was noted for volume and price extremes. Cross-sectional
normalization (ranking stocks by a feature each day) could also be beneficial for certain relative features
(though our focus is primarily time-series signals per stock).


Implementation Note: In practice, many of these features will be derived from the raw API fields within
the data pipeline (e.g. using pandas or SQL transformations). They should be added as new columns in
the feature matrix for each stock-date. The model can then be trained on these features to predict 1d, 5d,
10d, 20d forward returns. High-priority features should be developed and validated first (they offer the
most bang-for-buck in predictive accuracy), while medium/low priority ones can be added incrementally
to test incremental improvements. All features should be checked for leakage and correlation.


By leveraging the full breadth of J-Quants data, including price/volume history, sentiment and
positioning metrics, derivatives market cues, and fundamental events, this feature set is designed to
maximize short-term predictive power (especially for 1–5 day returns) while remaining robust and

available as of the prediction time, enabling realistic backtests and live trading usage.
