# Experiment 1 - Real-Time Monitoring

**Launch Time**: 2025-10-31 03:02:10 UTC
**PID**: 937203
**Status**: ✅ **ACTIVE** (Training in progress)

---

## 🎯 Experiment Configuration

**Objective**: Test Sharpe-focused loss weights to break Sharpe plateau

**Loss Weights** (Sharpe-focused):
```bash
SHARPE_WEIGHT=0.5     # ⬆️ 10x increase (was 0.05)
RANKIC_WEIGHT=0.2     # Balanced rank correlation
CS_IC_WEIGHT=0.1      # Cross-sectional IC
HUBER_WEIGHT=0.1      # ⬇️ Reduced MSE dominance (was 1.0)
```

**Training Parameters**:
- Max epochs: 25
- Batch size: 2048
- Precision: bf16-mixed
- Num workers: 8

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ **Minimum**: Sharpe > 0.10 by epoch 20 (+22% vs baseline 0.0818)
- 🎯 **Target**: Sharpe > 0.15 by epoch 25 (+83% vs baseline)
- 🚀 **Stretch**: IC turns positive (currently all negative)

## 📊 Training Progress

### Current Status (as of 03:04 UTC)

**Epoch 3/25** - Training phase
- Train loss: 0.2939 (vs 0.801 baseline epoch 1)
- Loss trend: ⬇️ **63% reduction** from baseline (promising!)
- GPU memory: 0.42GB used, 17.73GB cached
- CPU utilization: 88.5%
- Runtime: ~2 minutes elapsed

**Gradient Health**:
- GAT gradient norm: ~1.2e-02 (healthy)
- Gate mixing: alpha=0.5 (balanced GAT/projection)
- Combined norm: ~1.68e+03 (active learning)

**Graph Construction**:
- Edges built: 11k-13k per batch (good connectivity)
- Staleness: 1 day (fresh data)

## 🔍 Key Observations

### Loss Reduction (Very Positive!)
```
Baseline epoch 1: 0.801 (MSE-dominated)
Exp1 epoch 3:     0.294 (Sharpe-focused)
Reduction:        -63.3% ⬇️
```

**Interpretation**: Much faster loss reduction compared to baseline. This suggests Sharpe-focused loss is driving stronger optimization signals.

### Gradient Flow (Healthy)
- GAT gradients active (~1.2e-02, similar to baseline)
- No vanishing gradient warnings
- Balanced GAT/projection contribution

## 📈 What to Watch For

### Next 5 Epochs (Epochs 4-8)

**Critical Checkpoints**:
1. **Epoch 5**: First validation metrics
   - Look for: IC values (hoping for IC > 0)
   - Look for: Sharpe vs baseline (0.0818)
   - Decision: If improving → Continue

2. **Epoch 10**: Mid-point validation
   - Target: Sharpe > 0.09 (10% improvement)
   - Look for: Prediction scale > 0.00
   - Decision: If Sharpe < 0.08 → Abort and try Exp 2

3. **Epoch 15**: Trend confirmation
   - Target: Sharpe > 0.10 (minimum success)
   - Look for: Consistent upward trend
   - Decision: If achieved → High confidence for Exp 2

4. **Epoch 20**: Success criterion
   - Target: Sharpe > 0.10 (required)
   - Stretch: Sharpe > 0.12
   - Decision: If achieved → Approve 50-epoch validation

5. **Epoch 25**: Final evaluation
   - Target: Sharpe > 0.15 (ideal outcome)
   - Look for: Stable or improving IC
   - Decision: Select best config for Phase 2

## 🚨 Warning Signs (What Would Cause Abort)

**Abort Criteria** (check at epoch 10):
1. ❌ Sharpe < 0.08 (worse than baseline)
2. ❌ IC still all negative (no directional signal)
3. ❌ Prediction scale still 0.00 (no magnitude)
4. ❌ Loss increasing (divergence)

**If any abort criterion met → Launch Experiment 2 (Cosine LR)**

## 📋 Monitoring Commands

### Quick Status Check
```bash
# Process status
ps -p 937203 -o pid,stat,%cpu,%mem,etime,cmd --no-headers

# Latest epoch
tail -20 _logs/training/exp1_sharpe_focused_20251031_030210.log | grep -E "Epoch|Loss|Sharpe"

# Training progress
grep "train/total_loss" _logs/training/exp1_sharpe_focused_20251031_030210.log | tail -5

# Validation metrics (after epoch 5+)
grep "Val metrics" _logs/training/exp1_sharpe_focused_20251031_030210.log
```

### Real-Time Monitoring
```bash
# Live loss progression
tail -f _logs/training/exp1_sharpe_focused_20251031_030210.log | grep -E "Epoch|train/total_loss|val/loss|Sharpe"

# IC metrics (validation only)
tail -f _logs/training/exp1_sharpe_focused_20251031_030210.log | grep "IC="
```

### Comparison with Baseline
```bash
# Baseline 50-epoch Sharpe: 0.0818 (all epochs)
# Exp1 target: > 0.10 by epoch 20

# Extract Exp1 Sharpe progression
grep "Sharpe:" _logs/training/exp1_sharpe_focused_20251031_030210.log | awk '{print $NF}' | tail -10
```

## 🎯 Decision Tree

### After Epoch 10 (~12 minutes from now)
```
IF Sharpe > 0.09:
  → ✅ Continue to epoch 20 (on track for success)

ELSE IF Sharpe 0.08-0.09:
  → ⚠️ Continue to epoch 15, monitor closely

ELSE (Sharpe < 0.08):
  → ❌ Abort, launch Experiment 2 (Cosine LR)
```

### After Epoch 20 (~60 minutes from now)
```
IF Sharpe > 0.12:
  → 🚀 Excellent! Approve 50-epoch validation
  → Consider launching Experiment 2 in parallel

ELSE IF Sharpe > 0.10:
  → ✅ Success criterion met
  → Continue to epoch 25 for final evaluation

ELSE (Sharpe < 0.10):
  → ⚠️ Below target, evaluate at epoch 25
```

### After Epoch 25 (~90 minutes from now)
```
IF Sharpe > 0.15:
  → 🎯 Target achieved! Best config so far
  → Proceed to 50-epoch validation

ELSE IF Sharpe > 0.10:
  → ✅ Minimum success
  → Compare with Experiment 2 (if launched)

ELSE (Sharpe < 0.10):
  → ❌ Failed, use Experiment 2 or 3 instead
```

## 🔄 Next Steps After Completion

### If Successful (Sharpe > 0.10)
1. Extract final metrics and create comparison report
2. Launch Experiment 2 (Cosine LR) to compare approaches
3. After both complete, select best config for 50-epoch validation
4. Document findings in experiment log

### If Failed (Sharpe < 0.10)
1. Analyze why Sharpe-focused loss didn't help
2. Launch Experiment 3 (larger model capacity)
3. If Exp 3 also fails → Architecture investigation required
